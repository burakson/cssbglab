This just a single page application - a quick hack, really - to be able to easily play with
the background-image CSS property on some predefined container dimensions
(think about them as the templates for the most common used mobile device resolution).

JavaScript and CSS are self-contained inside the single index.html and there is an external dependency for jQuery.

The settings are automatically saved in localStorage across sessions (you need to be using a fairly recent browser, of course).
